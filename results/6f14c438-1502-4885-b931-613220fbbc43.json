Do NOT include any audio description or speech transcription.\nassistant\nThe video opens with an aerial view of a devastated area, showing extensive destruction with collapsed buildings and debris scattered across the landscape. The text overlay in Chinese mentions \"DeepSeek首次用于地震国际救援\" (DeepSeek first used in international earthquake rescue) and \"7小时攻克缅甸救灾语言关\" (7 hours to overcome the language barrier in Myanmar disaster relief). The scene transitions to a closer view of a damaged building, highlighting the extent of the damage with broken walls and twisted metal. The text continues to describe the use of a translation system developed based on DeepSeek for communication during the rescue efforts. The video then shifts to a digital interface with a chatbot named \"DeepSeek,\" displaying a greeting message: \"Hi, I'm DeepSeek. How can I help you today?\" The interface includes a timestamp and a \"New chat\" button, suggesting the use of a language translation tool in real-time communication. The final frame returns to the aerial view, reinforcing the context of the disaster relief efforts.\n\nAUDIO CONTENT:\nsystem\nYou are a helpful assistant that transcribes speech and describes audio content.
